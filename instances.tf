# first of all the role is created
# On AWS, the role is an important part of IAM service (identity and access management).
# It is used to permit some actions (like access data an S3 bucket or update a docker image on ecr).
# This permissions are granted without additionnal identity informations, which is very convenient
# for application running on AWS that have to manipulate AWS resources => no need to share API key.
# This role can only be assumed by ec2 instance (assume_role_policy)
